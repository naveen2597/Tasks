    <h2>Welocome To Tutor joe's</h2>
    
    <p>
        The movie opens with scenes of an aerobics class juxtaposed with a classroom of students taking an examination. The movie's two protagonists are featured in
         these scenes, with Terry Green (Kaye) participating in the aerobics and Bobby Chrystal (Lattanzi) taking, not very well it turns out, his last high school final, in French.
<br>
At first, Bobby's main goal for the summer before college appears to be losing his virginity, if not with his unrequited high school crush,
 Bonnie (Amber Denyse Austin), who dates a college student, then with any takers. Soon, though, the poor results of the French final are in, and Bobby must take a make-up examination and score at least 85% to retain his acceptance at his wealthy lawyer father's alma mater, Yale University. Mr. Chrystal (Kevin McCarthy) hires Terry, a skilled French tutor,
  to live in the Chrystal home during the summer and work with Bobby on passing his exam. In addition to her normal compensation, Mr. Chrystal offers to give Terry a bonus payment of $10,000 should Bobby pass.
<br>
Terry and Bobby begin working together, but Bobby's lack of interest in both French and Yale soon becomes apparent. His real goal is to attend UCLA and study astronomy. Terry is sympathetic, 
but reminds Bobby that wherever he ends up going to college,
 he will need to pass his French final. With Terry's help, Bobby begins to make some progress.
